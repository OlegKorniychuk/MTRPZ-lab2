# Conclusion
  Writing tests takes quite a lot of time and it doesn`t make sence for projects as small as this one - it took more time writing them than the actual code. However, benefits of testing are obvious in larger pieces of code - they are help to localize an issue much faster than just spamming console.log() everywhere. I also tried to imitate test driven development and liked this approach quite a lot - it helps to structurize my plans for an app.
